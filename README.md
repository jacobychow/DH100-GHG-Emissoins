# DH100-GHG-Emissions
  This repository seeks to analyze CO2 emissions data by country through a series of visualizations and discussions. It explores how emissions rates have changed over time and which entities have contributed the most to atmospheric carbon. I will explore both dimensions of space and time. How have carbon dioxide emissions across the largest emitters changed over the past 4 centuries? How do CO2 emissions compare between countries at a specific point in time? Overtime?

 
### About Me:
  I'm a rising senior studying environmental sciences with a minor in data science, and I am extremely passionate about sustainability. I have no clue what I want to do post graduation, but I know I want to contribute to the transition towards renewables.
